Production-ready, cloud-deployed microservices system that combines a Python Product Details API, a Node.js Dealer Pricing API, and a responsive JavaScript frontend on IBM Code Engine.

## Project Snapshot

Dealer Evaluation Microservices Deployment | GitHub | Mar 2026

- Engineered and deployed a full-stack microservices application by integrating Product Details (Python), Dealer Pricing (Node.js), and Dealer Evaluation Frontend on IBM Code Engine.
- Configured frontend-to-backend API communication by replacing placeholder endpoints with deployed service URLs, enabling dynamic product loading, dealer listing, and real-time pricing.
- Delivered a production-ready distributed system with seamless multi-service interaction, automated cloud deployment, and responsive UI behavior.

## Why This Project Stands Out

- Multi-language microservices architecture with clean service boundaries.
- Real API wiring between frontend and independent backend services.
- Cloud-native deployment workflow on IBM Code Engine.
- Strong distributed-systems behavior with responsive end-user experience.

## Architecture

      U[User Browser] --> F[Dealer Evaluation Frontend]
      F --> P1[Product Details Service - Python]
      F --> P2[Dealer Pricing Service - Node.js]
      P1 --> R1[(Product Data)]
      P2 --> R2[(Pricing Data)]
```

Each service is independently deployable and communicates over REST APIs, allowing modular scaling and faster iteration.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arshchouhan/devops-capstone-project.git
cd devops-capstone-project
```

Build and deploy each service using the Docker and pipeline assets available in this repository.

## Repository Highlights

- `service/` contains the core accounts service implementation.
- `service/tests/` includes API and behavior tests.
- `Dockerfile` provides container build support.
- `requirements.txt` defines Python dependencies.
